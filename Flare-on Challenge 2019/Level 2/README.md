# Challenge

An exe that tells us `I never broke the encoding:`
![](messagebox.png)

# Solution
I open the program with IDA, the main function is `start` at `0x4011c0` which call the `MessageBoxA` function at the end.\
At `0x4011CB` the `offset unk_402008` is being push with `1Ch (28)` at right after the `sub_401160` is called.\
The data at `unk_402008` seems encrypted.\
But at `eax` which equals `[ebp+Text]` is also being pushed, and this `[ebp+Text]` is used to Print the message.\
After so tries with ollyDbg the `1Ch` that was pushed to `sub_401160` determine the length to encrypt out of `unk_402008`.\
The `unk_402008` actual size is `AFh` if we modify the `1Ch` to `AF` at the push instruction the next line is being overwritten,\
so it can be modified in the stack.
