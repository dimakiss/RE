# Challenge

An exe file with a text box in format of the password text box:\
![](exe.png)

# Solution

This program was written by __.NET__, Detect It Easy verified it.
After opening the exe with `Dnspy` the classes and methods seems to be confusing on purpose:\
![](dnspy.png)

After some time its was easy to detect the `Form` main mathod and its __ctor__, the form named __Qnnnn__,\
and the __ctor__ is __unnnQ()__:\

In red can be seen the method that is called when clicked __onnnQ__, its the only click method so I assume that its `button click`.\

### onnnQ
Saves user input in *text* then take hard-coded  __encrypted__ and retrieve the hardcoded password, It can be easily traced.\
But to solve this CrackMe there is a simple solution, all its takes are to put Brack Point on the __MessageBox__ instruction,\
Debug the program, Enter any password you want after the `Dnspy` brakes just step over (F10) and the right password will be in the `Locals` window.\

And its pretty self explainable, `Qnnn/../.onnn/../ return ` is the return of `Qnnnn.onnnn(encrypted)`,\
and its checks if text equal to this string.
