# Challenge

A 2 mode crack me hard and easy

# Solution

I opened the exe with die.exe and it says that this is a __.NET__ application and protected with `Confuser X`.\

The deobfuscation. I opened the program with __dnSpy__, went for `<Module>` .cctor, brakepoint on `gchandle.Free()`.\
Run, and saved `koi` Module from Modules window.

The koi needs to be cleaned. I used open source __de4dot-cex__.\
I opened the cleaned koi with __dnSpy__.

The main function seems to be __smethod_0__ in __Class5__.\
