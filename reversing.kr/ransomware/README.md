## Challenge
we have an exe file that wait for us to input a key, text file that tells us to `Decrypt File (EXE)` and file seems like the file we need to decrypt.

the encripted file's content

## Solution

PEview show saction names UPX1, PEiD tells the same and  deep scan shows that the exe was packed with `UPX 0.89.6`

![](PEview.png) ![](PEiD.png)

I unpacked that UPX manually.Finding the OEP with olly,after `PUSHAD` in `0xECECE0` Memory Brakepoint on access word on the esp value,
the program will brake few lines before the jump to OEP.

Dumping in `0x44AC9B` the imports was reconstructed with `RECconstractor` whic point us that the import in `RVA 4BFFC`.
After going to DUMP in ollyDbg to `RVA 4BFFC`-->`0x44BFFC` the imports seems to start at `0x44c000` to `0x44C0CC` -->`import size=0xCC`, imports fixed and the exe works fine

IDA shows that the main function has alot of junck instruction 

`
push eax,
pop eax,
push ebx,
pop ebx,
pusha,
popa,
nop,
`

And after the junk which IDA commented at `Sorry,this node i too big to display`, the real code shows up.
The `sub_401000` seems to be junk code then jumping over in olly nothing happened we so its no seems important.

The main code tries to open file and read his binarys indeed the files name is `file` our encripted file
