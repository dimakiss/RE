# Easy Crack

## Challenge
We have an exe and Readme text file 
The exe wait for Name and serial, and the readme text file tells us to find the name that generates the serial `5B134977135E7D13`.

## Solution
We open Easy_keygen with ollyDbg we follow the step over until we get to the main function at `0x401000`.
The program saves the number `10` `20` `30` at `0x401038` for later use.

The program gets the Name at `0x401059`, we have a loop over the Name we inputted from `0x401077` to `0x4010B4`.
The `ESI` is a counter from 1-3 and its choose at `0x40107E` a number from the saved numbers `10` `20` `30`.
The first letter is XORed with `10` the second with `20` the third with `30` the fourth with `10` again and so on.
Every XORed number save at ecx with previous XORed numbers which is memory location (see `0x401090`) the function at `0x40109A` called sprintf
the function adds the previous numbers as a longer string (see the format `%s%02x`) at `0x401094`.

At `0x4010e2` and `0x4010e6`, we can see the generated serial moved to `ESI` and the inputted serial moved to `EAX`,
we can see a loop from `0x4010EA` to `0x401108` that compares 2 bytes at the time and choose to jump to the `badboy` or not.

The ReadMe.txt said we need to find the name that generate the sirial 5B134977135E7D13 from the sprintf format we know that every number added is length 2 
and we know that xor is Symmetrical means that a xor b=c, c xor a =b
the numbers we need to xor are `5B 13 49 77 13 5E 7D 13`
as we told the first will be xored with `10` the second with `20` and so on...
`5B 77 7D ` xor `10` --> `4b 67 6d `

`13 13 13` xor `20` --> `33 33 33`

`49 5E` xor `30` --> `79 6e`

combine back '4b 33 79 67 33 6e 6d 33' --> (ascii) `K3yg3nm3`
